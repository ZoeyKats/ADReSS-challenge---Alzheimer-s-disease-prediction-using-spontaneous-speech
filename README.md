# ADReSS-challenge---Alzheimer-s-disease-prediction-using-spontaneous-speech

Using the dataset provided for ADReSS challenge for interspeech 2020, i experimented with the classification problem. 
Specifically: 
1) I only use the transcripts and not the audio files
2) I only work on the predicion of AD, (0-1 binary classification) although with some minor changes i believe the code will be useful for predicting the MMSE score as well

The repository is seperated in 3 folders: 
1) Characteristics dataset: Refers to the dataset that was created using different characteristics from the speech of each participant and from CHAT encoding. The folder contains the file that created the dataset and also a file with different classification models, using grid search and many graphs. This repository is my thesis and the graphs were used for showing my results, that is why there are so many, though i believe they are probably useful 
2)
